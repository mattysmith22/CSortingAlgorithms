# Sorting algorithms

This is a simple project that I built, just to practice implementation of sorting algorithms. It is a command-line tool which when given a sorting algorithm from its list and then numbers as all the successive arguments will output the sorted list to stdout.

## List of sorting algorithms

* [betterbubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#Optimizing_bubble_sort)
* [insertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort#Algorithm)
* [merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Algorithm)
* [quick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm)
* [cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_shaker_sort#Pseudocode)

## Possible improvements

* Showing a live copy of all the values on stdout if given a certain flag
* Counting compares and swaps and outputting to stderr if given a certain flag
